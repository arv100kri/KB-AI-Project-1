===============

Simple Miller's Analogy Test. A:B::C:x

Console Version
-----------------

1. In the console version, all the four propositional representation files are taken as input, and the answer to each of them is echoed to
the system console, as and when the problem is solved. The line of output representing the answer is demarcated from the other information text
being displayed on the console.
2. Since the program displays lots of output in the console, it is possible that the terminal window (especially in case of Windows CMD), 
may truncate it and display only part of the output. 
3. The answer to each problem appears immediately as it has been solved. However, there is a summary at the end which lists out the answer to all the
questions.

Running the project
--------------------
	java -jar Project1.jar
	
	which is under the dist folder

The GUI is not uploaded here as it is a trivial extension

Project Report
---------------

The PDF of the project report is placed at Report/report.pdf
Please Note: Since latex is bad at tables, I have created an excel sheet for one of the tables in my report.
In case the table is not clear while reading, please do refer to the file "Propositional_Representation_Table.xlsx" in the same folder to have a better view.
