Conventions followed in the propositional representation
---------------------------------------------------------

Every problem in the Miller's test consist of two matrices. 
Matrix 1 will have several "frames", with an implicit relation 
existing between each frame. Matrix 2 will also have the same
number of frames, with one missing frame which needs to be chosen
from the options. Each frame will consist of a finite number of
"shapes" with certain attributes (type, color etc.,). The relations
that exist between the shapes of each frame in Matrix 1 should 
correspond to the shapes of each frame in Matrix 2. Thus the option which
satisfies this requirement will be chosen.

Syntax
------

Each line will be a key-value pair (separated by a ":"), with the keys as follows:

<<Matrix>>: Container for listing the frames in that portion of the figure
	<<MatrixId>>: Whose value is either 1 or 2.
			   1 = Matrix given in the question with all the frames known.
			   2 = The incomplete matrix with a missing frame.
			   3 = A pseudo matrix with the frames in the answer choices.
<<Frame>>: Container for the shapes and shape information.
	<<FrameName>>: Whose value is a name associated with that frame, obtained from the question.
	<<Shapes>>: Contains a list of shapes present in the frame, separated by a space. 
				Each shape is given an identifier like Circle1, Circle2, Line1, Rectangle1 etc.,
				In general <TypeOfShape><UniqueIdForThatShape>.
				The UniqueId for a shape will be incremental starting from 1.
	<<Frame-Relation>>: A comma-separated list that describes the relation 
						between the shapes in that frame. 
						It is in the form of a triplet <Shape1> "<Relation>" <Shape2>. 
						If needed the representation may vary as <Shape1> "<Relation>" <Frame>, which describes the shape relative to that frame.
						It is possible to not have an empty frame-relation for certain problems.
						The relation is described within quotes in English, using phrases like "Left of", "Right of", "Top of" and so on.
						
The Frame-Relation would be an ordered pair, whose order will be maintained across frames provided the shapes appearing in the relation
of one frame also appear in the relation of another. Otherwise the relation will be canonically changed, and the program will infer the 
loss/addition of new shapes in a frame.

Goal of the algorithm
----------------------
		
Based on the intra-frame relations of the shapes in this file, infer the inter-frame relationship in matrix 1 (intra-matrix relationship). 
From among the frames in the answer choices, choose the one which will result in the same inter-frame relationship
in matrix 2.
